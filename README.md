This image shows that I used Microsoft Azure to create a resource group that included a virtual machine, public ip address, network security group, and virtual network. I used this virtual network to connect to a remote desktop in order to install osTicket.

I logged into osTicket as Administrator "Jane Doe". As a admin I am able to add agents to osTicket, in addition I am able to add agents to a specific department or team. It also shows the last time each agent was logged in.

<p>
While logged into osTicket as Admin, I managed help topics, which basically includes potiental ticket scenarios. Properties such as, priority of the ticket, and also which department the ticket is sent to when created can be changed if necessary.
